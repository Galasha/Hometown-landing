            Located on the Black Sea, full of rugged coastlines, natural lakes,
            and untamed forests lies Ukraine. Ukraine is possibly one of the
            most overlooked countries in Europe. Although it might stay under
            the radar when it comes to Eastern European travel, this just makes
            visiting Ukraine even more of a hidden gem and a true travel
            treasure. From powerful architecture to sandy beaches and lush
            vegetation, Ukraine has it all.
